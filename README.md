# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, featuring an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that makes strategic moves using the Minimax algorithm.
- Simple command-line interface for playing the game.
- Displays the game board and announces the winner or a tie.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai

3. Run the game:
   python tic_tac_toe.py

Gameplay Instructions
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Enter the row (0-2) and column (0-2) where you want to place your mark "O".
3. The AI opponent will make its move ("X") based on the Minimax algorithm.
4. The game continues until a player wins or there's a tie.

AI Algorithm:
The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move. It evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes its chances of winning or minimizing its chances of losing.

Dependencies:
This project requires Python 3.x.
